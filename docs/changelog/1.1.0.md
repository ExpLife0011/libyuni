Yuni - Release v1.1.0
=====================


New
---

 * [sample] [parser] added json parser

 * [core] [event] added `fold` method for callback result folding
		Event<uint ()> evt;
		evt.connect([]() -> uint { return 10u; });
		evt.connect([]() -> uint { return 4u; });
		std::cout << evt.fold(0u, Lambda::Add<uint>()) << std::endl; // 14

 * [jobs] added the method `gracefulStop()` to the queue service to ask
   it to stop as soon as possible. The big advantage to this method is it
   can be called from any threads, unlike `stop()` which may create a
   deadlock if called from a job.

 * [jobs] added the method `clear()` to the queue service to remove all jobs
   waiting to be executed

 * [parser] JSON export

 * [core] Functional: Support for collection Views with fold, filter, map
   and many pre-defined binary operations for folding.

 * [core] String: Added operator overloads for easier UTF8::Char / multi-byte
   string comparisons.


Changes
-------

 * [core] Fold : Renamed from `Yuni::Functional::Fold` to `Yuni::fold`

 * [core] String: the method `String::format()` and `String::appendFormat()`
   now use `const char* format` instead of `const AnyString& format`.
   Reason: 'va_start' has undefined behavior with reference types. You
   can use `String::c_str()` if old code were using Yuni::String as input format.

 * [core] Jobs: The method `wait` of the queue service now requires an event
   to distinguish the different use-cases. Uses `qseIdle` to wait for all jobs
   being executed (this value should represent the old behavior of `wait`)
   or use `qseStop` to wait for the queue service being stopped (by
   `stop()` or `gracefulStop()`).

 * [core] Jobs: Overall Performance Improvement
