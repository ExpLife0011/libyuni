========================


New

 * **{core}** added System::Environment::ReadAsUInt64()
 * **{core}** added System::Environment::Exists() to test if a variable is defined
 * **{core}** added System::Environment::Unset() to remove an environment variable

 * **{core}** added String::swap()
 * **{parser}** added `Node::append` to easily append a new node


Changed
-------

 * **{core}** `DynamicLibrary::File` now uses enum class for the relocation type
   and the visibility scope (ex: `relocationLazy` -> `DynamicLibrary::Relocation::lazy`)
 * **{jobs}** `State` is now an enum class
 * **{jobs}** `Priority` is now an enum class (`priorityDefault` has been renamed to `Priority::normal`)
 * **{parser}** The generated code now relies on C++14 features
 * **{parser}** Fixed parsing on empty files
 * **{core}** Version: the attribute `revision` has been renamed to `patch`, to reflect the definition
   of semantic versioning. A new field `metadata` has been added as well.


Fixes
-----

 * **{core}** System::Environment::ReadAsInt64 now properly returns the
   default value if failed to convert to an int64

 * **{parser}** Added missing escaped characters \r and \t when printing the AST
