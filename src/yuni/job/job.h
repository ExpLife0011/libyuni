**    documentation
**  * If you distribute physical media, the YUNI source that you used to build
**    your application should be included on that media
** Make it clear where you have customised it.
**
** In addition to the LGPL license text, the following exceptions / clarifications
** to the LGPL conditions apply to YUNI:
**
**  * Making modifications to YUNI configuration files, build scripts and
**    configuration headers such as yuni/platform.h in order to create a
**    customised build setup of YUNI with the otherwise unmodified source code,
**    does not constitute a derived work
**  * Building against YUNI headers which have inlined code does not constitute a
**    derived work
**  * Code which subclasses YUNI classes outside of the YUNI libraries does not
**    form a derived work
**  * Statically linking the YUNI libraries into a user application does not make
**    the user application a derived work.
**  * Using source code obsfucation on the YUNI source code when distributing it
**    is not permitted.
** As per the terms of the LGPL, a "derived work" is one for which you have to
** distribute source code for, so when the clauses above define something as not
** a derived work, it means you don't have to distribute source code for it.
** However, the original YUNI source code with all modifications must always be

	**
	** This class is designed to implement a single task executed by
	** Job::QueueService.
	**
	** This clas can be used for wrapping a downloader, an image
	** processing algorithm, a movie encoder, etc.
	**
	** Indeed, doing time-consuming operations like downloads and database
	** transactions in the main thread can cause your user interface to seem as
	** though it has stopped responding while they are running. To avoid this
	** problem, you want to execute your long-running task in an asynchonous
	** manner (a background task).
	**
	** See async() for a more convenient way for simple tasks
