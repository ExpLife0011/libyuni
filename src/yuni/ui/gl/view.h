** Make it clear where you have customised it.
**
** In addition to the LGPL license text, the following exceptions / clarifications

**  * Building against YUNI headers which have inlined code does not constitute a

**  * Code which subclasses YUNI classes outside of the YUNI libraries does not

** As per the terms of the LGPL, a "derived work" is one for which you have to
** distribute source code for, so when the clauses above define something as not

	** \brief A view is a rectangle where 3D data is rendered inside a window
	**
	** View position and size is given in pixels
	** There can be several views in a window, overlapping or not.
	** The main usage is split-screen games.
	**
	** For overlapping, views have a Z-order.
	** Higher Z-order means closer to the viewer, 0 is furthest, 255 is closest.
	** Default Z-order is 127 (at mid-way).
	**
	** \warning Overlapping is not recommended for the moment, because the implementation is sub-efficient.
