** Make it clear where you have customised it.
**
** In addition to the LGPL license text, the following exceptions / clarifications
** to the LGPL conditions apply to YUNI:
**
**  * Making modifications to YUNI configuration files, build scripts and

**  * Building against YUNI headers which have inlined code does not constitute a

**  * Code which subclasses YUNI classes outside of the YUNI libraries does not

**    is not permitted.
** As per the terms of the LGPL, a "derived work" is one for which you have to
** distribute source code for, so when the clauses above define something as not
** a derived work, it means you don't have to distribute source code for it.
** However, the original YUNI source code with all modifications must always be

	**
	** The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of
	** identification numbers, such as credit card numbers.
	** It was created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn and described in U.S. Patent
	** 2,950,048, filed on January 6, 1954, and granted on August 23, 1960.
	**
	** it was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks
	** and it is a simple method for distinguishing valid numbers from collections
	** of random digits.
