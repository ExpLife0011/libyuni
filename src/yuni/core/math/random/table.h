	** \brief Pre-Cached table of random numbers
	**
	** This class behaves like any other random number generator except random numbers
	** come from a prefetch cache.
	**
	** \code
	** #include <iostream>
	** #include <yuni/core/math/random/default.h>
	** #include <yuni/core/math/random/table.h>
	**
	** using namespace Yuni;
	**
	** int main()
	** {
	**		// A table for pre-cached random numbers
	**		Math::Random::Table<Math::Random::Default>  randomTable;
	**		// Generating a set pre-cached random numbers
	**		std::cout << "Generating " << randomTable.size() << " random numbers..." << std::endl;
	**		randomTable.reset();
	**
	**		std::cout << "A random number : " << randomTable() << std::endl;
	**		std::cout << "Another one     : " << randomTable() << std::endl;
	**		return 0;
	** }
	** \endcode
	**
	** Do not forget that you have to reset the random number generator yourself,
	** As this operation may be costly, You may want to control it. The other
	** reason is that some specific parameters may be required
	**
	** Even if it is possible to make this class thread-safe (using the godd threading
	** policy, it is no really advised.  The real purpose of this class
	** is to avoid the high cost of a Random number generation (in a real-time
	** game for example) and additional locks might be costly as well.
	** In most cases you would prefer a `table` per thread.
	**
	** \tparam D Any random number generator
	** \tparam TableSize The count of random numbers to cache
	** \tparam Cyclic True to Cycle through the list or False to regenerate a new set
	** when all pre-cached random numbers are exhausted
	** \tparam TP The Threading Policy
