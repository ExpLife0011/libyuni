** In addition to the LGPL license text, the following exceptions / clarifications

**  * Building against YUNI headers which have inlined code does not constitute a

**  * Code which subclasses YUNI classes outside of the YUNI libraries does not

** As per the terms of the LGPL, a "derived work" is one for which you have to

	** \brief A Synchronous Event Demultiplexer (Reactor pattern)
	** \ingroup Core
	**
	** This class handles requests (from any thread or process) from a single
	** thread. It is designed to run code that can not be thread-safe, like
	** calls to OpenGL or OpenAL routines.
	** If those requests must be run from the main thread (e.g. OpenGL), the
	** event loop must not be detached (see the template parameter 'DetachedT')
	** and the method 'start()' must be executed from the main thread.
	**
	** Here is a sample to create a minimalist event loop
	** \code
	** class MyEventLoop : public Core::EventLoop::IEventLoop<MyEventLoop>
	** {
	** public:
	**	bool onLoop()
	**	{
	**		std::cout << "loop !\n";
	**	}
	** };
	** \endcode
	**
	** \tparam ParentT The parent class (CRTP)
	** \tparam FlowT The flow policy
	** \tparam StatsT The statistics policy
	** \tparam DetachedT A non-zero value to use a separate thread than the calling
	**   one for running the event loop.
	**   This value should always be true for code safety unless if you want to
	**   execute the event loop from the calling thread (e.g. the main thread).
	**   In this case, you _have_ to take care about blocking system calls that
	**   would prevent the loop to stop.
