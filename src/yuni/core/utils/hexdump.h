** In addition to the LGPL license text, the following exceptions / clarifications

**  * Building against YUNI headers which have inlined code does not constitute a

** As per the terms of the LGPL, a "derived work" is one for which you have to

	** \brief A simple hexadecimal buffer dumper.
	**
	** This dumper can dump any buffer (with start address and length),
	** or any class having a data() and size() member function.
	** (for example, String).
	** The output looks like the following:
	**
	** Sample usage:
	** \code
	** // Either call it with a memory buffer
	** std::cout << Core::Utils::Hexdump(myBuffer);
	**
	** // Or with a plain old char buffer.
	** char buf[256];
	** std::cout << Core::Utils::Hexdump(buf, sizeof(buf));
	** \endcode
	**
	** Sample output:
	** \code
	** 0x00604010: 0001 0203 0405 0607 0809 0a0b 0c0d 0e0f |................|
